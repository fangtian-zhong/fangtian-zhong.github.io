## Logistics
* Due: Monday, April 28th AoE.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required file (`practice.c`) is in your
	`csci112_spring2025/classwork/week16/mon/` directory.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice converting from decimal to binary and from binary to hex

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* From your home directory, navigate to `csci112_spring2025/classwork/week16/mon/`, creating directories `week14`
and `wed` if necessary.
* Copy the file `/public/classwork/week16/mon/practice.c` into your directory.

Assign values to `x, y, z, a, b, c` using binary and hexadecimal encodings as
described in the file. Remember the trick for converting from binary to hex!

When you've succeeded, you'll get six `PASS`es when you run your executable.

Note: of course you could just find a decimal to binary and hex converter
online and use that to get full credit on this assignment. But what's the point
of that?

## Autograder

You can run the autograder by running

```
/public/classwork/week16/mon/autograder.sh
```

The file `autograder.txt` will be created with your score.

## Grading turnaround

The autograder will be run at 6am to calculate final scores. Scores will be
uploaded to D2L by the next class period.
