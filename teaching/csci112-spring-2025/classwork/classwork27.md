## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, April 23rd AoE.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required files are in your
	`csci112_spring2025/classwork/week15/wed/` directory.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Learning outcomes
* Use `valgrind` to find memory errors and leaks

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* From your home directory, navigate to `csci112_spring2025/classwork/week15/wed/`, creating directories `week15`
and `mon` if necessary.
* Copy the file `mem.exe` from the `/public/classwork/week15/wed/` directory into your directory.

This assignment will be graded by hand.

Run `mem.exe` with `valgrind`. In a new file called `mem.txt` in your `csci112_spring2025/classwork/week15/wed/` directory, answer the following questions:

1. How many memory *errors* are there?
2. How many memory *leaks* are there?
3. Describe the memory errors. What sort of thing do you think caused them? How
   do you know?


## Grading turnaround

Scores will be uploaded to D2L by the next class period.
