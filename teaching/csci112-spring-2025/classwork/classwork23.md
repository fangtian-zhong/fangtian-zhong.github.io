## Logistics
* Due: Monday, April 7th AoE.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required file (`dynamic.c`) is in your
	`csci112_spring2025/classwork/week13/mon/` directory.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice using `malloc` and `calloc` to allocate memory on the heap.

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* From your home directory, navigate to `csci112_spring2025/classwork/week13/mon/`, creating directories `week13`
and `mon` if necessary.
* Copy the file `/public/classwork/week13/mon/dynamic.c` into your directory.

Fill in the three `TODO` items. You should only need to add four lines of code.

## Autograder

You can run the autograder by running

```
/public/classwork/week13/mon/autograder.sh
```

The file `autograder.txt` will be created with your score.

## Grading turnaround

The autograder will be run at 6am to calculate final scores. Scores will be
uploaded to D2L by the next class period.
