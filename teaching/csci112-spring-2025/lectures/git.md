title: "Git"

We will use git to manage lab and program submissions in this course. At
minimum, this allows our TAs to quickly access your assignments that you
"submit" on the server, and allows you to get some basic practice with an
extremely
important tool in the software development world. You can also choose to use
git more extensively to manage your work in this class.

## Git basics

Git is a version control system, meaning that it is meant to keep track
of changes to code. It's especially useful for collaborating, but it can also
be used when working by yourself so that you can keep a history of your changes
and why you made them.

Git is *not* GitHub. GitHub is a service that hosts many git repositories.
Other similar services include GitLab and BitBucket. In this course, we will
not cover hosting services.

Other version control
systems include Mercurial and Subversion. Because these are version control
systems, they are comparable to git. In this course, we will focus on git, not
other version control systems.

### Git repositories

The basic organizational unit in git is called a *repository*, or a
*repo* for short. As the name implies, it is a place to store things. In
practice, a repository is a directory in your filesystem. Any subdirectories
are also part of the repository. For example, at some point during this class,
your `csci112_spring2025` directory might look like this:
```
csci112_spring2025/
├── classwork
│   ├── week1
│   │   └── fri
│   │       ├── autograder.txt
│   │       └── example.txt
│   └── week2
│       └── wed
│           ├── autograder.txt
│           ├── hello_world.c
│           └── out.txt
└── labs
    └── lab1
          ├── autograder.txt
          ├── lab1.c
          └── temp.txt
```
This means that the `csci112_spring2025` directory contains two subdirectories,
`classwork` and `labs`, each of which can contain their own subdirectories, and
inside those subdirectories are various files.

If we make `csci112_spring2025` a git repository, all of the subdirectories and
files inside of it are part of the repository.

### Git commits

The snapshots of our repository that we use git to record are called *commits*.
We make a commit every time make a change that we would like to record.
Although we may only change one file, a commit is actually a snapshot of the
entire directory at the time that we make the commit. In practice, making a
commit looks like this:

```
git commit -m "<Put a description of the changes made in this commit in the quotes>"
```

### Staging in git (`git add`)

Git includes an extra step to making a commit that many other version control
systems do not: *staging*. In order to make a commit, we first must *stage* our
changes: that is, tell git which files were changed and should thus be included
in the next commit. We can either stage files by name:
```
git add file1.txt
```
or we can stage all files in the repository that have changed:
```
git add -A
```

Note that you must stage your files before you can commit them!

## Setup for assignment submission

For this course, we're going to create a git repository and use it to tag
the version of our programs that we would like to be graded.

### Creating a git repository

To start, create a directory. For this course, your directory should be called
`csci112_spring2025`, so we will use that as an example. You should already
have this directory, but if you didn't, you would create it using `mkdir csci112_spring2025`.

Navigate into the directory:

```
cd csci112_spring2025
```
Initialize a git repository inside the directory:
```
git init
```
You will see the following message. You can ignore the first part about hints:
```
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/<your_netid>/csci112_spring2025/.git/
```

But notice the last line: `Initialized empty Git repository in /home/<your_netid>/csci112_spring2025/.git/`.
 `csci112_spring2025` directory is now a git repository!

Try running `git status` to see the status of your repository. You should see
something like this:
```
[g73x595@csci112 csci112_spring2025]$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	classwork/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

If you just created your `csci112_spring2025` directory for the first time and it
is empty, you will need to create a file something for git to track. You could do this by opening a new file
with `vim`, putting some text in, and saving it. Or you can copy the following:
```
echo "Hello, world!" > example.txt
```
(The `echo` command prints whatever you specify to the screen; the `>`
redirects that output to a file instead of the screen.) You may want to check
that the file is there by running `ls`.

Now, we can stage all of your files by running
```
git add -A
```
The `-A` is for "all". Now, if you run `git status`, you should see:
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   classwork/week1/fri/autograder.txt
	new file:   classwork/week1/fri/example.txt
	new file:   classwork/week2/wed/autograder.txt
	new file:   classwork/week2/wed/hello_world.c
	new file:   classwork/week2/wed/out.txt
```
This means that all of the files in your repository have been staged.

Now, we are finally ready to commit. We also need to provide a description of
this commit, called a commit message, which we specify with the `-m` option
followed by our message in quotes. For example, we might do:
```
git commit -m "Add previous classworks"
```
And then we see a message like this:
```
[master (root-commit) 2c82f20] Add previous classworks
 5 files changed, 30 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 classwork/week1/fri/autograder.txt
 create mode 100644 classwork/week1/fri/example.txt
 create mode 100644 classwork/week2/wed/autograder.txt
 create mode 100644 classwork/week2/wed/hello_world.c
 create mode 100644 classwork/week2/wed/out.txt
```
Running `git status` again shows that we have no unsaved changes:
```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
We can run
```
git log
```
to see a history of all of  our commits. In this case, it looks something like
```
commit 9a8c77c95593a302436dfb9509663658271f43e9 (HEAD -> master)
Author: fangtian.zhong <fangtian.zhong@montana.edu>
Date:   Fri Jan 10 18:40:50 2025 -0600

    Add previous classworks
```

### Tagging a commit

If we want to label a commit because it is important or we want to be able to
access it easily, we can give it a tag. **In this class, you will use git tags
to indicate which version of your code we should grade.**

To create a tag, run `git tag <tagname>` after you have committed your changes.
You can run `git log` to check that your tag was associated with the right
commit. For example, we might run
```
git tag example_tag
```
and then
```
git log
```
and see
```
commit 2c82f20e9b41b4fe09b6c142d381dce32f95abe3 (HEAD -> master, tag: example_tag)
Author: fangtian.zhong <fangtian.zhong@montana.edu>
Date:   Fri Jan 10 19:55:31 2025 -0700

    Add example.txt file
```
Note the tag at the end of the first line!

You'll notice that if you make a new commit and try to tag that commit with a
tag `tagname` that has already been used, you'll get this message:
```
fatal: tag '<tagname>' already exists
```

To solve this, first delete the tag
```
git tag -d <tagname>
```
and then tag as normal
```
git tag <tagname>
```

You can tag a previous commit by referencing its commit hash. For example, if I
run `git log` and see something like this:
```
[g73x595@csci112 csci112_spring2025]$ git log
commit 71203455057227331ac8384f3f2c2a1910ef5094 (HEAD -> master)
Author: fangtian.zhong <fangtian.zhong@montana.edu>
Date:   Fri Jan 10 09:08:12 2025 -0700

    Add a example file

commit aa08bd749ec35221abd90ce0908fa7279714e3c1 (origin/master)
Author: fangtian.zhong <fangtian.zhong@montana.edu>
Date:   Fri Jan 10 16:38:34 2025 -0700

    Update

commit 3601b167efb9a1c6ed3f384c55a720c740f4ab07
Author: fangtian.zhong <fangtian.zhong@montana.edu>
Date:   Fri Jan 10 20:19:37 2025 -0700

    lab1

commit 5170dff5f9795001a837407645ed55cae24e43d9
Author: fangtian.zhong <fangtian.zhong@montana.edu>
Date:   Fri Jan 10 20:18:53 2025 -0700

    Update
```
and I want to tag the commit with the comment "lab1" with the tag `lab1` , I could run
```
git tag lab1 3601b167efb9a1c6ed3f384c55a720c740f4ab07
```


### tl;dr

Once you have a version of your lab or program that you would like to "submit",
(i.e., be the one we grade if you don't update it), do this:
```
git add -A
git commit -m "<description of your changes, or just name of assignment>"
git tag <specified tag for assignment>
```

If the tag already exists, do `git tag  -d <specified tag for assignment>`
before the third command above.

## Common issues

### Nested repositories

In general, you do not want to have nested git repositories. This is what
happens if you run `git init` in one directory, and then run it again in one of
the subdirectories of that directory later. You'll know if you have nested
repositories if `git log` looks different in different directories of your
repository.

Let's get a better understanding of what this means with an example. Suppose that
you have one directory called `directory`, and inside it you had two
directories called `subdir1` and `subdir2`, and maybe those have a few files in
them. Visually, that looks like this:

```
├── directory
│   ├── subdir1
│   │   ├── file1.txt
│   └── subdir2
│       ├── file2.txt
│       └── file3.txt
```

If at some point you had run `git init` when you were in `directory`, then
`directory` (and everything in it, including the subdirectories) is now being
tracked as a git repository. This means that there is a `.git` directory inside
`directory`, so the file structure actually looks like this:

```
├── directory
|   ├── .git
│   ├── subdir1
│   │   ├── file1.txt
│   └── subdir2
│       ├── file2.txt
│       └── file3.txt
```

(Note that we don't see `.git` unless we look for hidden files, for example by
running `ls -a` when we're in the `directory` directory.)

Now suppose we navigate to `subdir1` and run `git init`. This creates another
(nested) repository inside `subdir1`, so there is another `.git` directory
under `subdir1`, and `subdir1` is a new git repository with its own commit
history.

```
├── directory
|   ├── .git
│   ├── subdir1
│   │   ├── .git
│   │   ├── file1.txt
│   └── subdir2
│       ├── file2.txt
│       └── file3.txt
```

But the whole idea of a repository is that it tracks everything inside of it.
So now the `directory` repository is tracking `file1.txt` and so is the
`subdir1` repository, but there's just the one file and so it really only makes
sense to track it once.

If you realize you have created a nested repository, make sure you understand
the level that you really want your repository to exist, and then delete the
unneeded one by deleting the associated `.git` repository. The command to do
this will be different depending on where you currently are. If you're in
`directory`, it would be `rm -rf subdir1/.git`. `-r` says delete all
subdirectories recursively, and `-f` says force the deletions without checking
whether you want to delete each file. (There are a lot of them in there.) Note
that this deletes the whole commit history and can't be undone, so make sure
you delete the correct `.git` directory.

## Optional: more advanced git

### Adding a remote to your repository

If you would like to connect your `csci112_spring2025` repository to GitHub,
do the following steps. You must choose whether to use HTTPS or SSH to
communicate with GitHub. Either is fine, but HTTPS is simpler, so I recommend
that.

1. [Create a new repository on GitHub.com](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).
Do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files.
**Please make this
repository private so that I can reuse assignments for this course without the
solutions being available online!** Copy the remote url with https in it.
2. On the server, navigate to your `csci112_spring2025` repository and run
```
git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>
```
3. Now run
```
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

You may need to [generate and enter a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) here.

Everything in your repository is now stored on the connected GitHub repository
as well! But updates are not automatic. After any new commits, if you would
like to send them to the GitHub repository, run
```
git push
```

### Cloning that repo to your local computer

To copy over the files in your `csci112_spring2025` directory (and now on
GitHub as well) to a local computer, clone the GitHub repository.

In a terminal window, enter
```
git clone <REMOTE_URL>
```

This will create a directory called `csci112_spring2025` that holds everything
that was in the GitHub repo. If you make an update there (by pushing from the
server) and want to get that update on your computer, navigate into the
`csci112_spring2025` directory and run `git pull`.
