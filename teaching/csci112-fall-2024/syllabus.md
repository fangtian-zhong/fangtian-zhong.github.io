## Catalog description

3 Credits.
PREREQUISITE: CSCI 127. Programming knowledge. Introduces imperative programming and the C standard library. Course covers pointers, memory management and structures.


## Course Info

This course meets for lectures on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from
8:00-8:50am in Leon Johnson Hall 346. The first 30 minutes of lecture will be spent learning new material, and the last 20 minutes will be spent on small programming assignments (or on short quizzes). We will use Slack as the primary method of course communication, and all course information will be posted on this website or on the Slack server; D2L will
be used *only* for grading.

There is an *optional* lab on Fridays from 12:00pm to 4:00 pm in ROBERT 111 that you may attend to get extra help.

Note that this class is for Computer Science and Computer Engineering majors.
If you are not one of those majors, you should take CSCI 109 instead of this
course.

## Course Resources

### Textbook

The textbook is optional for this course, but is a good resource for anyone who
is interested. Most classwork and lab programming assignments will come from
the book, and lectures are based on the content in the book as well.

*Problem Solving and Program Design in C*, by Jeri R. Hanley & Elliot B. Koffman, Eighth Edition.

You can find free PDFs of the textbook online.

### Linux server

We have a shared course server for you to develop, compile, and run your C
programs on. Details for how to access the server can be found on the [lecture 1
page](https://fangtian-zhong.github.io/teaching/csci112-fall-2024/lectures/tools).

### Optional open lab and TAs

There is an optional lab on Fridays from 12:00 to 16:00 pm in ROBERT 111.
*Note that there is no lab during the first week of classes (Friday, August 23rd)!* However, after this week, even
when no lab is due, there will still be TAs in the lab to help you.


### Instructor office hours

My office hours are 9:00am-9:50am on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays in the Barnard 352. You can also contact me on Slack to set up a
different meeting time, and join the slack by [the link](https://join.slack.com/t/montana-izi8174/shared_invite/zt-2oyzs4ewy-5yrdf~RtrHUR6FVjKEcF~w), or drop by my office (Barnard 352) if my door is open.
You can find office hours for all CS faculty [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/office-hours.html).

### SmartyCats

There is SmartyCats tutoring for this course! Visit [their
website](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats) to find out more.
You can also [apply to be a SmartyCats tutor yourself](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats/apply.html) for other CS courses you've taken, or for this one next semester.

### Computer Science Success Center
There are free tutors available in Barnard 259. More information [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html).

### Slack server

All course communication will be through our course Slack server. See D2L
announcement for link. Please change your nickname to your full name (first
and last). Additionally, I suggest managing your notification settings. You may also need to manage the application notification settings on your device.

## Course outcomes
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
* Navigate a Linux operating system using the command line.
* Use `vim` to edit files.
* Use `git` to version control their work.
* Write code using C syntax.
* Build computer programs using the C language.
* Take advantage of major capabilities of the C language, including pointers, dynamic memory allocation and structs.
* Apply the power of pointers, structs and strings to C programs.
* Apply the programming knowledge you learned to solve basic real-world problems.

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 29 classwork assignments (lowest five dropped): 20%
* 13 labs (lowest two dropped): 40%
* 12 in-class quizzes (lowest two dropped): 40%

Your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are three ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), post in the `#errors-in-course-material` channel on Slack. I will decide whether
it's truly an error and not a duplicate. If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Additional work throughout the semester

Since five classworks, two labs and two quizzes are dropped, your work on dropped
assignments may
be counted as a bonus. You get:

* 0.5 point for a score of 80% or more on any lab beyond your required 11, and
* 0.1 point for any completed classwork beyond your required 24.
* 0.5 point for a score of 80% or more on any quiz beyond your required 10

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 75% or more of the class completes the mid-semester course survey, the whole
class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation.

### Late assignment policies
To run a course of this size we cannot accommodate individual requests for
extensions on assignments; therefore, we have strict rules for when assignments
are due, but have some leeway built in. Please read the bullet points below carefully,
respect the policy, and *get help early if
you are having any problems.* We want you to succeed!

* You are responsible for any announcements about assignments  made in class, on Slack, on D2L,  and here
	on the course website.
* All assignments are due on their due date by the [Anywhere on Earth (AoE)
	timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe), which is 6 hours behind Bozeman (Actually, it's only 5 hours behind during standard time, but we'll go with 6 hours behind at all times). This means that the real due
	date is 6am the following day. If you submit labs and programs  within 24 hours of the due date, you get 25% off of whatever score you earn. If you
	submit within two days of the due date you get 50% off.
	Otherwise, no points are possible.
* You can submit as many times as you would like; only your last submission will be
	graded.
* Classwork cannot be submitted late.

### Missed quiz policy

Note that quizzes are taken in-class.
Any conflicts with a quiz must be discussed with me prior to missing the quiz.
I follow University policy on makeups, which allows that serious illness or a
serious family emergency are valid reasons requiring an accommodation.

### Collaboration policy
On all assignments, you may:
* Share ideas with others.
* Help others debug their code (or receive help debugging your code from someone
	else).

You may not (unless the assignment explicitly says you can):
* Share your code with other people.
* Submit code that you did not write.
* Use generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to search for approaches or ideas to
	assigned coding problems.
* Modify someone else's solution and claim it as your own.
* Post your own solutions on the internet.
* Post the course assignments or quizzes on the internet.

### Academic misconduct

In line with the [MSU student code of conduct](https://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/#academichonesty), if I or the teaching assistants suspect that you have committed academic misconduct, we will schedule a meeting with you to discuss. If, after the meeting, we believe that you did commit academic misconduct, you will receive a 0 on the assignment and I will submit a report to the Dean of Students. It's just not worth it to cheat in this course.

## Important dates

The last day to drop the course online (with no instructor or advisor approval)
is September 4th. The last day to drop without a W grade (instructor or advisor
approval required) is September 11th. The last day to drop with a W grade
(instructor and advisor approval required) is November 13th. See the full
[add/drop schedule](https://www.montana.edu/registrar/add_drop_schedule.html)
for more information.
