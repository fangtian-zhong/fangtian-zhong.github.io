## Logistics
* Due: Friday, February 21st AoE.
* Submission instructions: ensure that you have the source code you want us to
	grade in a file called `project.txt` in your submission
	directory. You need to describe what you have done and what you have observed, including relevant screenshots, command snippets, and code snippets. For any important command snippets or code snippets you must also include a supporting explanation. Simply including commands/code without any explanation will not receive credit. For any interesting or surprising observations, you also need to provide explanations. You are encouraged to pursue further investigation, beyond what is required by the lab description.


## Learning outcomes

The learning objective of this project is for students to familiarize with WinDbg commands for kernel debugging. The kernel is the heart of the operating system, and it resides in the file ntoskrnl.exe. If we want to trace back the system libraries to the kernel functions, instead of merely having its effect returned, we should utilize kernel-debugging tools. Among them, WinDbg is the most useful one provided by Microsoft.All system APIs will finally transfer the invocation to the kernel, as shown in the figure below, from the "Practical Malware Analysis" book.
