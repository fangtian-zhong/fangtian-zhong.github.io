## Logistics
* Due: Monday, March 10th AoE.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required file (`tokenize.c`) is in your
	`/classwork/week9/mon/` directory.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice using `strtok` to tokenize a string

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* From your `csci112_spring2025` directory, navigate to `classwork/week9/mon/`, creating directories `week9` and `mon` if necessary.
* Copy the file `tokenize.c` from the `/public/classwork/week9/mon`
	directory.

In the file `tokenize.c`, fill the code needed for the `TODO`. After you have
filled in the correct code, compiling and running your program should look like
this.

```
[g73x595@csci112 mon]$ gcc tokenize.c -Wall
[g73x595@csci112 mon]$ ./a.out
Bozeman is in MT, USA
```

You can run the autograder by running

```
/public/classwork/week9/mon/autograder.sh
```

The file `autograder.txt` will be created with your score.

## Grading turnaround
Final scores will be run at 6am on the due date and scores will be
uploaded to D2L by the next class meeting.
