## Logistics
* Due: Thursday, November 13th AoE.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required assignment5.py and document (assignment5.doc) is submitted to Canvas
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for this assignment.

## Outside resources

On this assignment, there are no restrictions on the use of outside resources for help in any way, including use of AI tools like ChatGPT.

## Assignment

* Develop a assignment5.py that starts at the programâ€™s entry point, identifies the subset of functions and instructions that form a viable execution path to the backdoor and ultimately produces the flag. For each identified element, provide: disassembly snippets, a short description of its role, a call graph highlighting the selected functions, and control-flow graphs (CFGs) with the critical functions/instructions clearly annotated (e.g., circled or otherwise emphasized) in the assignment5.doc. Download the binary [here](./backdoor.exe)

## Grading--30 points
   For each malware, you get 6 points if your solution is fully correct and 0 otherwise.
   
## Grading turnaround
Final scores will be run at 6am on the due date and scores will be uploaded to Canvas by the next class meeting.
