## Biography
 Dr. Fangtian Zhong is an assistant professor at Montana State University . He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from George Washington University in 2021, advised by Prof. [Xiuzhen Cheng](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~cheng/). He moved to Pennsylvania State University in 2021 where he worked as a postdoctoral scholar, expanding his research skillset from single architecture to multi-architectures. 
A year later, he joined University of Notre Dame as a postdoctoral research associate to further his research in machine learning to cybersecurity. His research primarily focuses on software security, program analysis, and machine learning for cybersecurity. He has published two ESI 1% highly cited papers.
