I do not take phd students this year, and positions have been filled until 2026 Fall. Students with a master degree and strong security background are preferred (e.g., could you explain static analysis, dynamic analysis, cfg, cg, reverse engineering, intermediate language?). 3.3/4.0 in GPA is required at MSU. If you are a prospective PhD student, I highly suggest reaching out to me early so that we can both check if there is a fit between us.
