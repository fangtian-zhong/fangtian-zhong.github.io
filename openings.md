I regularly take phd students every year. Students with strong security background are preferred (e.g., could you explain static analysis, dynamic analysis, cfg, cg, reverse engineering, intermediate language?). If you are a prospective PhD student, I highly suggest reaching out to me early so that we can both check if there is a fit between us.
